# WEBGLProject
A fun WebGL project to make an intereactive web portfolio game that non gamers are able to enjoy, have fun and get the information they want without needing to figure out the controls or think that it is obnoxious to have to play the game to ge the information. Project is inspired by WebGL portfolio https://bruno-simon.com.
